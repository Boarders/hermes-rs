# Hermes

A client-side app for JSON schema type inference and jq-style transformations, built with Leptos. The JSON inference is almost entirely taken and inspired by [this excellent post](https://haskellforall.com/2025/08/type-inference-for-plain-data) by Gabriella Gonzalez.

## Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
make setup

# Start development server
make serve
```

This will start a development server at http://127.0.0.1:8080 with hot-reloading.
